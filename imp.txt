how to convert map to list

List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> list=new ArrayList<Map.Entry<String,Integer>>(h.entrySet());



groupedWords.putIfAbsent(firstLetter, new ArrayList<>());
groupedWords.get(firstLetter).add(word);



1. putIfAbsent(firstLetter, new ArrayList<>());
This line ensures that a key-value pair for the current starting letter (firstLetter) exists in the TreeMap.

putIfAbsent(K key, V value):

If the key (firstLetter) is already present in the map, it does nothing.
If the key is not present, it inserts the key with the provided value (new ArrayList<>() in this case).
Purpose:
This ensures that there’s always an ArrayList ready to hold words for that starting letter.

Example: Suppose firstLetter is 'a' (from the word "apple"):

If 'a' is not already a key in groupedWords, it adds 'a' with an empty list:
groupedWords.put('a', new ArrayList<>()); → groupedWords = {a=[]}
If 'a' is already a key, it skips adding it and moves to the next line.
2. groupedWords.get(firstLetter).add(word);
This line retrieves the list corresponding to the current starting letter (firstLetter) and adds the current word (word) to that list.

How It Works:

groupedWords.get(firstLetter) retrieves the list associated with the key firstLetter.
Example: If firstLetter is 'a', it fetches the list stored at key 'a'.
.add(word) appends the current word to the fetched list.
Purpose:
This adds the current word to the correct group (list) for its starting letter.

Example: Continuing from the first line:

If the current word is "apple", and groupedWords is {a=[]}, then:
groupedWords.get('a') returns the list [].
.add("apple") updates the list to [apple].
After this line, groupedWords becomes: {a=[apple]}.
Combined Example:
Suppose the input is ["apple", "banana", "apricot", "blueberry"].

First Iteration (word = "apple"):

firstLetter = 'a'
putIfAbsent('a', new ArrayList<>()) → Adds 'a' with an empty list: {a=[]}
groupedWords.get('a').add("apple") → Adds "apple" to the list: {a=[apple]}
